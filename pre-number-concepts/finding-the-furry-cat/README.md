## Scene 1 - Intro (Finding the Furry Cat!)

The picture shows the cover of a story or poem called “Finding the Furry Cat!”

In the center, the title is written in large red letters against a blue sky with white clouds and flying birds. On the left side, there is a tall stick with a yellow round sign showing the number 1 — this means it’s the first chapter or poem.
Below the title, a long spotted tail, like that of a cat or animal, stretches across the ground. Near the tail, a small brown bird is sitting happily on the back of a white furry cat, which is lying down and cuddling with a gray mouse. They look friendly and peaceful together.

To the right, there’s a couple of yellow flowers growing from the ground. At the bottom left, two children are singing joyfully — a boy and a girl holding a microphone, smiling and enjoying their song. Below them, it says “Let us Sing” in red letters.

The whole image feels cheerful, playful, and full of warmth — just right to begin a fun story about finding a cat.

## Scene 2: Looking for My Furry Cat!

It is a bright, sunny day in a small village courtyard. The sun smiles down from the sky, and birds chirp on the red-tiled roof of a house. Three children are in the yard — one girl in a yellow dress points excitedly toward the house, while two other children, a boy and a girl, look in the same direction.

A white furry cat is jumping into the open window of the house — this seems to be the cat the children are searching for. A white cow is calmly eating green grass near the front steps.

In the background, there are haystacks, green trees, and a man sleeping on a wooden cot under a tree. Two squirrels play near a bowl on the ground. The scene feels peaceful and full of life — children searching, animals playing, and nature all around.
