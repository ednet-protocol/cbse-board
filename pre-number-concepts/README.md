## 🌸 Overview

This section introduces **spatial awareness**, **classification**, and **observation** — foundational skills required before number learning.
Children learn to describe positions (above, below, near, far, inside, outside, on, under), recognise patterns, and group objects based on properties.

These concepts form the **pre-number foundation** on which counting, comparison, and arithmetic are later built.

## 🪶 Core Mantras

| 🧿 Mantra                         | 💬 Description                                                         | 🔗 References                      |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **`above-below-on-under` 🪶**     | Understands relative position of objects (above, below, on, under).    | → `positional-awareness`, ← `none` |
| **`inside-outside-near-far` 🌳**  | Identifies spatial relations of objects in and around the environment. | → `positional-awareness`, ← `none` |
| **`before-after-between` 🚂**     | Recognises order and sequence through train/bogie example.             | → `ordering`, ← `none`             |
| **`grouping-objects` 🧩**         | Classifies objects based on shape, size, or colour.                    | → `classification`, ← `none`       |
| **`national-flag-position` 🇮🇳** | Recognises *top*, *middle*, *bottom* positions using tricolour flag.   | → `above-below`, ← `none`          |

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

* Describe **positions** of people or objects in daily life.
* Develop **vocabulary** for spatial relationships.
* Build **observation** and **description** skills.
* Sort objects into **logical groups**.
* Recognise **patterns of arrangement** and **sequences**.

## 🪷 Pedagogical Notes

| Concept              | Suggested Activities                                          | Inclusive Adaptations                                                        |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Positional words** | Play “Find the object” game using inside/outside/above/below. | Use tactile contrasts (rough/smooth zones) or auditory cues (ghungroo ball). |
| **Flag colours**     | Draw/colour *tiranga*, identify *top*, *middle*, *bottom*.    | Offer pre-textured flag outlines for differently-abled students.             |
| **Before / After**   | Children form a “train” line and describe positions.          | Use name tags for verbal reinforcement (“Riya is before Meena”).             |
| **Grouping**         | Collect and group natural objects: leaves, pebbles, seeds.    | Use multi-sensory categories (colour, texture, sound).                       |

## 🪔 Teacher Guidelines

* Use **rhymes** and **enactments** to teach through motion and sound.
* Encourage **discussion** around each positional term.
* Involve **environmental context** — playground, classroom, garden.
* Ensure **participation by all** children through adapted play.
